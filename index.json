[{"content":"Hi! I am smujahed, but calling someone by their GitHub handle in the real-world is a bit\u0026hellip; awkward. So, let me introduce myself properly. I am Shereif, the resident decoder of the nanoscale! I spent way too many years wrestling with equations until they finally awarded me a PhD in Computational Condensed Matter physics. From the jazz cafe of atoms, to the electronic dance of bits and bytes,Â the universe whispers its stories through data.\nPhysics was my lens into the \u0026ldquo;universe\u0026rdquo;, however, after a while one begs the question: Is this actually the whole universe? In the context of my academic career, the answer was always a resounding \u0026ldquo;Yes!\u0026rdquo;, but outside of this career context the answer is much more\u0026hellip; grey. So, with a foundation in computational physics and some data science tools, let\u0026rsquo;s find some answers to that question!\n","date":"1 January 0001","permalink":"/about/","section":"About me","summary":"Hi!
